# Example prompt 1:
## Generate a publication-quality volcano plot with the x-axis representing log2 Fold Change and the y-axis representing -log10 FDR. Color points red for significantly upregulated features (log2FC > 1 and FDR < 0.05), blue for significantly downregulated features (log2FC < -1 and FDR < 0.05), and grey for all others. Add a horizontal dashed line indicating the significance threshold at FDR = 0.05, and vertical dashed lines at log2FC = 1 and -1. Ensure the plot has a clean white background with no grid lines.
