# ggplotAgent: A Self-Debugging Multi-Modal Agent for Robust and Reproducible Scientific Visualization

ggplotAgent translates your natural language prompts into publication-quality scientific visualizations. Describe the plot you need, and the agent generates it for you.

## Examples

Here are several examples of plots generated by ggplotAgent using different datasets and prompts.

### Example 1: Volcano Plot

**Dataset:** `examples/volcano_example.csv`

> **Prompt:** Generate a publication-quality volcano plot with the x-axis representing log2 Fold Change and the y-axis representing -log10 FDR. Color points red for significantly upregulated features (log2FC > 1 and FDR < 0.05), blue for significantly downregulated features (log2FC < -1 and FDR < 0.05), and grey for all others. Add a horizontal dashed line indicating the significance threshold at FDR = 0.05, and vertical dashed lines at log2FC = 1 and -1. Ensure the plot has a clean white background with no grid lines.
