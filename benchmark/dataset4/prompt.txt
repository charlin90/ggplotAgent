For the 'Apoptosis' pathway, create a plot showing the mean pathway_activity_score at each time_point, faceted by treatment. Represent the mean as a large point. Add vertical error bars representing the standard deviation at each point. Finally, connect the mean points for each treatment with a line to show the trend.
For the 'DrugX' treatment, create a 'rain cloud plot' for the pathway_activity_score of each pathway at time_point 72. This composite plot requires a half-violin plot on top, a box plot underneath it, and jittered raw data points (the 'rain') below the box plot.
This figure presents a series of time-series heatmaps, offering a detailed view of how cellular pathway activities respond to 'Control', 'DrugX', and 'DrugZ' treatments over a 72-hour period. Each row tracks the activity of a single pathway in one patient, with color intensity indicating its normalized activity level over time. The 'Control' heatmap reveals a largely stable, heterogeneous pattern, representing the system's baseline state with no strong, uniform trend. In stark contrast, the 'DrugX' heatmap shows a clear shift towards warmer, redder colors as time progresses, particularly at the 72-hour mark, indicating a broad-spectrum activation of pathways. The most dramatic effect is seen in the 'DrugZ' panel, where a powerful inhibitory signature emerges; the majority of pathways transition from neutral or warm colors to deep blue, illustrating a systematic shutdown of cellular activity driven by the drug. The clustering of rows further highlights distinct groups of pathways that respond in concert to each specific treatment.
Create a ridgeline plot to show the distribution of pathway_activity_score for each pathway, with the ridges stacked vertically. Facet this entire plot by treatment.
